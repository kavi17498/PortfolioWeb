# My React Profile Landing Page

This is a simple **React** landing page featuring a profile section with a brief introduction, profile picture, and some attractive styling. The page is designed with **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and modern design elements.

## Features

- **Profile section**: Displays a profile image with a description and heading.
- **Gradient background**: Adds a vibrant, modern look to the landing page.
- **Responsive design**: Uses Tailwind CSS to make the layout adaptable to different screen sizes.

## Demo

You can view the live demo by running the application locally (explained below).

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. You can download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd your-repository-name
npm install
```

### 3. Run the project

To start the React development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the application in your browser. By default, it will open at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

```bash
my-profile-landing-page/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── images/
│   │       └── profile.jpg
│   ├── components/

│   └── App.js
├── public/
│   └── index.html
├── package.json
├── tailwind.config.js
└── README.md
```

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the React app.
- **`assets/`**: Stores images, such as the profile picture (`profile.jpg`).
- **`components/`**: Contains the Slider component (`Slider.js`), which displays the profile section.
- **`App.js`**: The main component that renders the `Slider` component.
- **`tailwind.config.js`**: The Tailwind CSS configuration file.

## Tailwind CSS Setup

This project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling. If you need to adjust or customize styles, you can modify the classes in the `Slider.js` component.

### Tailwind CSS Installation

To ensure Tailwind CSS works in your project, make sure the following dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

If Tailwind CSS is not already set up, you can create the configuration files by running:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

Then, make sure the `tailwind.config.js` file contains the following content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

And ensure your `index.css` imports Tailwind's default styles:

```css
/* index.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Customization

You can easily customize the appearance of the profile landing page by modifying the following:

- **Text**: Change the text in the `Slider.js` component, such as the heading (`Welcome to My Profile`) and description (`Hello, I'm Kavindu!`).
- **Profile Picture**: Replace the image in `src/assets/images/profile.jpg` with your own image.
- **Styling**: Modify the Tailwind CSS classes in `Slider.js` to adjust margins, font sizes, colors, or even add animations.
